/**
 * Uisng your solution to ques 2, add a getter method to the counter class so that you can retrieve the value
 * of the counter. Update your main thread so that after it interrupts the counter it also joins withthe counter thread.
 * After the join completes, use the get method to obtain the coutner value and print out the vlaue.
 * Note that you use join to ensure the child thread has completed before you can fetch the counter.
